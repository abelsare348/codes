print("Hello"+"world")  # + - join the strings
str1='fresh'
print(str1*3+" ")  # * - we can multiply the string

print('fr' in str1)  # in - membership operator used to check whether particular member of string or not.

#print("they said,"its ok" ")   # will give error as there are two "" inovlved


print("they said,\"its ok\" ")  # by adding \ before " will allow us to write the string in perfect format

#although u can solve this problem in python by following approach.

print(""""they said,\"its ok\" """)

print("pyhton \
      is not good\
      for web development")

# and we can ignore this escape sequence by adding raw i.e r before the start

print(r"pyhton \

      for web development")

print("Hello world I am Aniket \r\n I am 26 . \r\nI m good\rI loc ")

#\r - carriage return or cursor control returns to
